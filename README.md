# PiggyBank Security Project

This repository contains smart contract security examples demonstrating vulnerable and secure implementations of a PiggyBank contract, along with an attack contract to demonstrate the vulnerabilities.

## Contracts

### VulnerablePiggyBank.sol
A vulnerable implementation of a PiggyBank contract that demonstrates common security flaws in smart contract development.

### SecurePiggyBank.sol
A secure implementation of a PiggyBank contract that addresses the vulnerabilities present in the vulnerable version.

### AttackPiggyBank.sol
An attack contract designed to exploit the vulnerabilities in the VulnerablePiggyBank contract, demonstrating how these security flaws can be exploited.

## Purpose

This project serves as an educational resource for understanding smart contract security vulnerabilities and best practices for secure smart contract development.

## Getting Started

To interact with these contracts, you'll need:
- A Solidity development environment (like Remix, Hardhat, or Truffle)
- An Ethereum testnet or local blockchain for testing

## Security Learning

This project demonstrates:
- Common smart contract vulnerabilities
- How to identify security flaws
- Best practices for secure smart contract development
- How to write attack contracts to test security

## License

This project is for educational purposes.
